# Feedback Control Law of Solar Sail with Variable Surface Reflectivity at Sun-Earth Collinear equilibrium points  
The work in this repository was done as part of a course project (AS5545: Dynamics and Control of Spacecraft - IIT Madras)  

The pdf discusses the concept involed and my views on the paper "Feedback Control Law of Solar Sail with Variable Surface Reflectivity at Sun-Earth Collinear equilibrium points" by Lorenzo Niccolai, Giovanni Mengali, Alessandro A. Quarta, Andrea Caruso in detail.  

The plots and computation performed in the said paper is reproduced using Python. The same can be found in the ipynb file.
